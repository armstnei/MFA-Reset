        <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
        <p>
            Phishing is a fraudulent practice where cybercriminals impersonate legitimate individuals or organizations to trick you into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card details, or personal data. These deceptive attempts usually occur through emails, messages, or fake websites that seem genuine at first glance.
        </p>

        <h2>Dangers of QR Code Scanning</h2>
        <p>
            QR codes are convenient and widely used for various purposes, but they can also pose risks if not used cautiously. Here are some potential dangers associated with QR code scanning:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Malicious links: Cybercriminals can create QR codes that lead to phishing websites or sites containing malware.</li>
            <li>Fake apps: Scanning QR codes can direct you to download apps from unverified sources, which may contain harmful software.</li>
            <li>Data theft: Some QR codes may trigger actions that steal personal information from your device.</li>
            <li>URL obfuscation: QR codes can mask the actual destination URL, making it challenging to verify the link's legitimacy before scanning.</li>
        </ul>
